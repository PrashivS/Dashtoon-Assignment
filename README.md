# Neural Style Transfer with PyTorch

This project implements Neural Style Transfer (NST), an exciting technique in deep learning that merges two images—one content image and one style image—to create a composite image with the content of the former and the aesthetic style of the latter. Our implementation utilizes PyTorch, a powerful deep learning framework, and Pillow for image processing.

## Features

- **Neural Style Transfer**: Combines the content of one image with the style of another using convolutional neural networks.
- **PyTorch Implementation**: Leverages the flexibility and efficiency of PyTorch for model training and inference.
- **VGG Models**: Uses the VGG-16 model, trained on the CIFAR-10 dataset, and a pre-trained VGG-19 model for high-resolution datasets.
- **d2l.ai Reference**: Incorporates best practices and methodologies from the d2l.ai resource for deep learning.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- PyTorch
- Pillow



## Training the Model

. The pre-trained VGG-19 model is also available for higher-resolution datasets.
